## Motivation
As students who do not stay on campus and have to travel long distances to get to school, timetable planning is very important for us to reduce time wasted. This can allow us to better focus on our studies and extracurricular activities, without the burden of excessive commuting. Likewise, for students who may have mobility difficulties, timetable planning is crucial to avoid unnecessary travelling across venus which may be inconvenient.  

## Aim
We aim to create a web application where users can easily generate an optimised timetable based on criteria that the user provides instead of having to try many different permutations on NUSMods.
